  <div class="heading-1">Iterative Redesign</div>
  <div class="section-1">
    <div class="heading-2">Introduction</div>
    <p>Our objective with this project was to tackle a startup’s problem statement, design a solution to the problems they listed, and complete a full iterative design process. We sought to strengthen our skills of co-designing and co-building, working collaboratively to develop a clickable prototype. An important part of this project included interacting with our client, a startup lead product designer, and learning how to ask clarifying questions, receive and incorporate feedback, and meet client’s expectations. We practiced receiving design critiques, from peers, professors, and startup representatives, as well as critiquing our peers designs. </p>
    <p>We really enjoyed this experience and developed our skills as UIUX designers, working together to address client’s problem statements, update our wireframes according to feedback we received, and produce a clickable prototype. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section-2">
    <div class="heading-2">Defining the Problem</div>
    <p>We worked with Uno Health, specifically Elise Livingston, who is the lead product designer for the startup. Uno Health identifies eligible Medicare members and enrolls them in assistance programs. Uno Health’s problem statement is that they would like to attract Medicare brokers and incentivize them to refer their members to Uno Health. Along those lines, they would like to support Medicare brokers checking their members’ eligibility or directing their members to check their own eligibility, and encourage Medicare brokers to direct members towards Uno’s services. </p>
    <p>We began by meeting as a group to review our project brief, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oXaMT9ASuKrr6cdrQAoIaNFBcgzsV1yOf4nkDTWl6oI/edit#heading=h.4053qytzk2ya">Uno Health - Engaging Medicare Brokers</a>. We carefully refined our questions to ensure they were specific and relatively easy to answer; our questions can be viewed in the comments section of the project brief, linked above. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section-3">
    <div class="heading-2">Sketching</div>
    <p>We began by each sketching 2 hand drawn end-to-end flows to solve Uno Health’s problem statement, attempting to incorporate all of the key functionalities discussed in the project brief. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section-4">
    <div class="heading-2">Wireframes</div>
    <div class="heading-3">First Iteration</div>
    <p>After reviewing all of our sketches side-by-side, we discussed the elements that we found the most effective in each sketch, carefully referring back to the project brief to ensure we were addressing the startup’s problem statement. We then created a quick sketch that combined the best elements of each of our sketches, which can be viewed below. </p>

    <p>Here is our first iteration of our low-fidelity wireframe. The Figma can be viewed <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/VkRiORYpMcQM692EsoAkOL/CS1300-Iterative-Design---Uno-Health?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=Ax8esJqbN471OtQX-0">here</a> on page “First Iteration Low-Fidelity Wireframe.” </p>
    
    <div class="heading-3">Wireframe Critiques</div>
    <p>
      In your handin, include a brief description of the suggestions for improvement from your peer and client critiques. Make sure to clearly note which suggestions come from your peers and which are from your client (or Vanessa & Talie).
    </p>
    <div class="heading-3">Updated Wireframes</div>
    <p>
      Include your updated wireframe in your hand-in. Write a short paragraph describing which changes you made, which suggestions from critique you decided not to include, and why.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section-5">
    <div class="heading-2">High Fidelity Prototyping</div>
    <div class="heading-3">Visual Style Guide</div>
    <p>
      In your hand-in, briefly explain your decisions for your style guide about color, general theme, typography, etc.
    </p>

    <div class="heading-3">Interactive High Fidelity Prototype</div>
    <p>
      You must include this link in your final hand-in. Briefly explain your design choices in your hand-in.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section-6">
    <div class="heading-2">Final Founder Feedback</div>
    <p>
      Then take notes on the founder’s comments and concerns, and include the notes in your hand-in submission.
